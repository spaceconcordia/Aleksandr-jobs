#Digital thermistor (DS18B20)

The DS18B20 digital thermometer provides 9-bit
to 12-bit Celsius temperature measurements and
has an alarm function with nonvolatile user-
programmable upper and lower trigger points.
The DS18B20 communicates over a 1-Wire bus
that by definition requires only one data line (and
    ground) for communication with a central
microprocessor.
